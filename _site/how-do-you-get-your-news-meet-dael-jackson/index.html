				<p>Meet <a href="https://twitter.com/honestturtle">Dael Jackson</a>. She is 32 and runs the box office at a theater department at a Catholic college. She’s a newly-minted MBA and she loves to travel. In her words: “I find it so relaxing to remove myself from everything I know and love to get to know other cultures. I took a second job a bit over a year ago specifically because it offered me the option to travel abroad sometimes. The job itself is really rewarding and I don’t think I’d give it up now, but the original selling point was absolutely the travel. Most recently I was in South Korea. It’s an amazing country with kind people, and I don’t think I’ve ever felt safer as a women and a foreigner. Between my bad chopstick skills and being a vegetarian, I was really sick of bread and kimchi by the end of the week, though. *^-^* I love to go hiking and read as well, both of which I get to do a bit more since I’m not independently wealthy. They both serve as an escape from daily life, which is something I really appreciate since my job is pretty stressful.”</p>

<p>Dael, who tweets @<a href="https://twitter.com/honestturtle">honestturtle</a>, was kind enough to answer some questions about her news consumption for my series “<a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">How Do You Get Your News?</a>” If you’d like to participate, let me know.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do you get your news?</strong></p>

<p>I have a pretty wide number of places I get my news. On TV I watch CBS in the morning before work (local for a half hour and national for a half hour) and The Daily Show &amp; Colbert at night. Driving to and from work I listen to NPR, about an hour of time total. If there’s a particular story I want to learn more about, I’ll use BBC or Al Jazeera online and recently I’ve been turning to Tumblr and Reddit more for stories that I don’t feel like I’m getting the full picture on.</p>

<p><strong>2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span.</strong></p>

<p>After thinking way too long, the best fit I can think of is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awf45u6zrP0">this video</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3. How do you take your coffee?</strong></p>

<p>If possible, with peppermint creamer. If not, milk and a splenda.</p>

<p><strong>4. Who’s doing it right in news?</strong></p>

<p>One person that’s really impressed me lately on Tumblr is the person who writes <a href="http://iwriteaboutfeminism.tumblr.com/">I Write About Feminism</a>. Despite the blog title, she’s been doing an amazing job with the Michael Brown shooting. She does a lot of content aggregation from those on the front line and answers a lot of questions from her followers. Also, she loudly and publicly admits it when she gets something wrong, which is something I find amazing in a person and in a media source. The other thing that I’ve recently fallen in love with is <a href="http://bitofnews.com/">bit-of-news</a>. I usually know their top stories, but the second set of longer reads is a must for me most of the time because they’re so interesting and eclectic. (<strong>Mel note: </strong><a href="http://socialmediadesk.tumblr.com/post/101702955716/reddits-bit-of-new-bot">See here</a> for more about bit of news.)</p>

<p><strong>5. What’s the first news event that you remember?</strong></p>

<p>The Berlin Wall falling. I remember thinking how strongly those people must feel to literally rip out pieces of concrete.</p>

<p><strong>6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?</strong></p>

<p>On Thanksgiving I got to feed my 7-week-old niece her bottle. The way she looked at me while she ate was just breath-taking.</p>

<p><strong>7. Where do you live?</strong></p>

<p>Emmaus, PA</p>

<p><strong>8. What do you absolutely hate about the news?</strong></p>

<p>That I no longer feel like anywhere will give me the whole story. Instead it’s what fits in a short segment and is often aimed to confirm their audience’s existing viewpoints. I think it’s so easy to leap to wrong conclusions and the news doesn’t often serve as a balance to that like I think (or maybe just wish) it should.</p>

<p>Thanks for this. Its been really interesting to actually think about how I consume news!</p>
