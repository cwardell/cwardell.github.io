				<p>Meet <a href="https://twitter.com/rcshore">Rob Shore</a>. By day, he’s a mild-mannered creative director who specializes in the public presentation of research findings. Outside of work, he co-founded a coworking space and <a href="http://rcshore.com/about.php">digital media collaborative</a>, where he creates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogfd1ZDpVvA">hilarious films</a> and award-winning documentaries. He used to live in a yurt in Mongolia. He’s one of my favorite people to follow <a href="http://instagram.com/rcshore">on Instagram</a>, in part because he travels all over the world.</p>

<p>When Rob’s not traveling, he’s based in DC. I was extremely glad when Rob said he would answer these questions. He was extremely enthusiastic about his willingness to participate: “Loving what you’re doing. Send telegram, email, phone number, or chloroform soaked handkerchief.”</p>

<p>We emailed. Rob answered. Here are his answers. If you’d like to participate, let me know. If you want to read the rest of the series, <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do you get your news?</strong></p>

<p>I wake up and turn on <a href="http://wamu.org/">WAMU 88.5</a>. Jerry Edwards follows me into the bathroom and into the shower. It’s not as creepy as it sounds. Upon toweling, <a href="http://www.rachelmaddow.com/">Rachel Maddow</a> enters the picture. Just like she has every weekday morning for roughly six years. We have breakfast together. We cry, we learn. I think she thinks we laugh, but we don’t often. On the bus, it’s me and <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/">Terry</a>. Sometimes the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">New Yorker</a> if she’s had an off week. I no longer try to convince myself that the <a href="http://www.economist.com/">Economist</a> is good for me. When I get to work I scan Facebook. I have a large and inaccurate number of friends, many of them who have been hidden because they have broken a complex and sacred set of rules that I have developed over the past decade. I have a perfectly curated little world: liberal, smoke, mirrors, memes, technology and cinephilia. Among all of my various feeds, services, readers, and aggregators (<a href="http://zite.com/">Zite</a> is quite good), I actually have no better source for news that predictably entertains, educates, and delights me than my little self-selected group of 100 or so newsfeed fodder feeders. Call me old fashioned. Lunch is with <a href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/">Jon</a> or, increasingly, with the newer, edgier <a href="http://www.iamjohnoliver.com/">John</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unnamed-1.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-339" src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/unnamed-1.gif" alt="elaine" width="299" height="225" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>**3. How do you take your coffee? **</p>

<p>Black, with cream.</p>

<p><strong>4. Who’s doing it right in news?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ezraklein">Ezra Klein</a> is doing it right and doing it early and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O53yqG0KgmQ">doing it and doing and doing well</a>. Plus he’s reppin’ Adams Morgan.</p>

<p><strong>5. What’s the first news event that you remember?</strong></p>

<p>I remember when the Challenger exploded. I guess I would have been four. I was at my friend Robert Reid’s house and my mother arrived to pick me up crying. Years later I went to the launch of the Columbia with my roommate Sumeet, whose aunt Kawlpana Chawla was on board. Needless to say, she never came back. It was a pretty devastating coda.</p>

<p><strong>6. What do you absolutely hate about the news?</strong></p>

<p>Nancy Grace.</p>
