				<p><a href="http://myhomeontheroam.blogspot.com/"><strong>ReAnn Scott</strong></a> is one of those people you read about and think, “Jeez, I wish I was more like ReAnn.” In her words, “I’m a slightly crazy, silver-haired, 68-year old retired CEO, widow, mother of 2 sons and grandmother of 1 perfect granddaughter.</p>

<p>I was a professional singer/dancer in my youth (performed as a member of many Broadway touring companies when they came to Chicago, including the first touring company of HAIR!) who along the way had a couple of great ideas that grew into successful businesses. Besides several states in the US of A, throughout the years I’ve also made my home in Belgium, Mexico and the Caribbean. Since retiring, I served in the Peace Corps as a Small Business Adviser and criss-crossed the US, alone in my 30’ Winnebago, for a year and a half while writing for several travel magazines.</p>

<p>I recently made the decision it was time to begin what probably will be my last, grand adventure. I am letting my apartment go, selling most of my ‘stuff’ and setting off on a solo, round-the-world tour that should take me about a year and a half to complete. I’m excited, scared and can’t wait to get started.”</p>

<p><a href="http://myhomeontheroam.blogspot.com/">This is her travel blog</a> that she’ll maintain as she hits the road, and here are ReAnn’s answers to how she gets her news. If you don’t work in news, don’t live in DC/NYC, and would like to be interviewed, let me know. The <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">rest of the series is here</a>, and thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/lepitts">Leanne Pittsford</a> for putting me in touch with ReAnn.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>1. How do you get your news?</strong></p>

<p>I still get the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/">Chicago Tribune</a> delivered four days a week. I watch the morning news on TV, read the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">NY Times</a> and USA Today online, and if I really want to know what’s going on in the rest of the world, I’ll watch <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/">BBC America</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2. Please send me a gif or video that captures your attention span</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/reann.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-354" src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/reann.jpg" alt="reann" width="173" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>My keys??! I can never find my keys!!!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>**3. How do you take your coffee? **</p>

<p>I don’t – I’m a tea drinker</p>

<p><strong>4. Who’s doing it right in news?</strong></p>

<p>Mornings – of the Big 3, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/">CBS</a> seems to be trying to hardest to deliver more hard news and less ‘fluff.’ The Big 3, in the evenings, are completely interchangeable. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/">PBS New Hour</a> does a great job and the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a> covers the world the best.</p>

<p><strong>5. What’s the first news event that you remember?</strong></p>

<p>That affected me, the shooting of JFK.</p>

<p>**What was the best thing that happened to you this week? **</p>

<p>My youngest son called to say he was going to ask his beautiful Melissa for her hand-in-marriage.</p>

<p><strong>7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?</strong></p>

<p>That Fox is allowed to give their one-sided, right-wing opinions and call it news! What’s worse, some people that actually believe their crap!</p>

<p><strong>11. What’s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?</strong></p>

<p>I listen to music while doing chores.</p>

<p>**12. How do you plan to get your news when you travel around the world? **</p>

<p>Online. Access to TV or even an English-language radio or newspaper will be limited by my travels.</p>
