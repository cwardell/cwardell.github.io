				<p>I recently left my job at NPR. I thought a lot about how to leave and thought I would write up exactly what I did, in case it helps you at some point in the future. I read online that you’re supposed to do a lot of this stuff before telling your bosses that you’re leaving. I suppose if you work at a place where they immediately escort you out of the building when you give notice, then you should do a lot of this stuff ahead of time. I wasn’t worried about that and did most of this stuff during the week before my last day.</p>

<p><strong>several weeks before leaving: </strong>After I received written confirmation from my new job, I called my boss and said I had accepted a new job. I emailed HR and two other bosses and suggested a last day. They said sure. I put this in writing for HR and emailed several people I worked with closely, to let them know. I asked if they would keep the information to themselves until it was publicly announced. They all did. I told my parents and A’s parents and asked them not to say anything. They kept the news to themselves. I went to California for Christmas and tried not to think about it. I was maybe 70% successful.</p>

<p><strong>week of leaving: </strong>Here’s what I did the week before I left:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I use Mac Mail. I exported all of my mail to Dropbox and an external hard drive. (<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14884">Instructions here</a>.) I copied over the work that I wanted to include in my work portfolio to the Dropbox as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>1a. I wrote <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/i-have-some-news/">a blog post</a> that I posted that coincided with the internal announcement by my boss. He ran his email past me before he sent it out, which was really nice. I set my blog post to post at the same time and then announced the news on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mkramer/posts/10204704877995520?pnref=story">Facebook</a> and Twitter.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A day later, I asked my Facebook friends for a checklist of things to do before leaving. People offered a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mkramer/posts/10204718807743755?pnref=story">range of suggestions</a>, mostly humorous.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I realized I would want a record of the Social Sandbox, which was a big part of my job. I rounded up <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/social-sandbox-mega-recap-post/">all of the posts</a> on the sandbox, so I could have a record of the pieces I had written or edited and make it easy for people to navigate the archives.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>4. Exported all of the email addresses I had ever written to from my work email. About 1,000 of them were NPR staffers and 1,000 were external emails. I wrote <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204735168392761&amp;set=a.1317220204265.89004.1043541181&amp;type=1">this email</a> to everyone at NPR and sent it, cc’ing my personal email. I then wrote a quick Excel program to process email addresses for everyone outside of NPR. [The Excel program looked for email addresses within my contacts that didn’t include the expression ‘@npr.org’ and then added a comma after each email address so they could be bulk pasted into Gmail. I’m sure there was an easier way to do this but my method worked.*]<a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-19-17.00.17.png"><img class="  wp-image-420 aligncenter" src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-19-17.00.17.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-19 17.00.17" width="559" height="326" /></a>This was the email I bcc’ed to my external contacts. I sent it from my personal email, so followups after I left could be answered. There is a limit on the number of emails you can bcc. I believe it is 500 so I split these into two batches.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I took pictures <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10204764675250414&amp;set=a.4621207361879.219285.1043541181&amp;type=1">of things</a> I didn’t want to forget.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote pass-off documentation, and made sure all of my documents on the NPR Confluence board were comprehensive and complete. I changed the ownership on every single Google Doc I had access to, removed myself as an admin from every social media account, and deleted access for myself to anything communal. I found new admins for docs where I was the only admin. This actually took quite a bit of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spent the last two days of work going around to each floor of the building and trying to talk with everyone I had ever worked with. This was great and made me cry a lot. I worked at NPR for the better part of eight years. I worked with many people across all different departments and it was nice to talk with them in person. I did a lot of laps around the building and listened and chatted. I also wrote emails to folks and made plans to get lunch with several people after my last day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did an exit interview. This consisted of two parts: one, to let me know about COBRA and rolling over my retirement fund. The other part consisted of asking why I was leaving. This was with my HR business rep in his office.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I cleaned out my desk. I emailed my union (SAG-AFTRA) to let them know I was leaving.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I purchased a duffel bag with a retro NPR logo from the gift shop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I added a new user to my Macbook Air and then deleted the ‘Melody Kramer’ user. This took a LONG time. I would recommend leaving a day or two at the end for this, and then using a personal laptop if you still need one. I then returned my laptop and all of the audio equipment I had checked out.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I believe that is everything!</p>

<p>*Someone asked for the exact method:</p>

<div>
  1. Exported email addresses. I googled this.
</div>

<div>
  2. Converted the file to a csv through some online website. (Google the conversion)
</div>

<div>
  3. In excel, I looked up how to find a string of characters. I searched for <a href="http://npr.org/" target="_blank">npr.org</a> and said &#8220;If <a href="http://npr.org/" target="_blank">npr.org</a>, put a 1 in the next row)
</div>

<div>
  4. Then I sorted the 1&#8217;s column
</div>

<div>
  5. then I had a list of emails that were not <a href="http://npr.org/" target="_blank">npr.org</a> addresses
</div>

<div>
  6. Then I looked up how to add a comma to the end of each of those.
</div>

<div>
  7. Copy and paste.
</div>
