				<p>I worked in a rare books library during college. People came into the library to pore over documents. Most of the time, they were writing a paper or an biography and needed primary documents to piece together someone’s life.</p>

<p>How could we write one of those now, without relying on any correspondence whatsoever? How could you could track me for an entire day?</p>

<p>Let’s start with the easiest and work our way up.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Where have I been? (Google Location History) (Instagram Location Endpoint) (Foursquare Location Endpoint) (WAZE) (Photos from the Department of Homeland Security) (E-Z Pass Data) (Uber) (Car2Go/ZipCar) (bike-sharing)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What was I reading? (Pocket history) (Chrome history) (Instapaper history) (Kindle history: did you stop reading [ie stop turning pages] at certain parts, highlight passages)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What event(s) did I attend? (Eventbrite history) (Ticketmaster database) (FB events)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What were my thoughts on X? (social media)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was I hot or cold? Was at home or at the office? (Nest data) (Hue data)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did I purchase anything? (Credit card data) (Square data) (Amazon history)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When was I likely commuting? (Twitter data - when was I not posting, correlated with Metro data)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was I where I said I was? (Instagram EXIF Location endpoint data - related: <a href="www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lawmaker-with-lavish-decor-billed-private-planes-concerts/2015/02/23/c7754d72-bbac-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html">this AP story</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was I on a job interview or giving a speech? (Twitter data: did lots of people from the same company follow me at once?) (Did I have an Out of Office message up?)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Matt Terenzio asks, “Were you playing a sport or on a merry-go-round?” (<a href="http://www.funf.org/about.html">Funf</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Josh Tauberer says to call this a “Auto-meta(data)-graphy,” which is a term I really like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sue Diaz says “What were you wearing (tracking sensor data from wearables.) Did you check anything out of a library? (If we could access that data) Park in a parking garage? Feed a meter? Use satellite radio? (You were on metro today but if you drive)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Melanie Cooper writes, “How was my health? What was I eating? How much did I weigh? How well did I sleep? How active was I? data points:(myfitnesspal,Jawbone UP,FitBit,Endomondo, Period Calendar/Tracker app)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What was I watching? data points: (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Hulu, YouTube, Redbox. Similar to Kindle, did you pause, rewind, or stop watching at certain points)</p>

<p>What was my mood? datapoints: (Period Calendar/Tracker app, Facebook emoticon, MoodPanda, weather app)</p>

<p>What was I listening to? datapoints: (pandora history, google music, spotify, itunes, youtube music)</p>

<p>What were my interests? datapoints: (google app reviews history, who you follow on social media, pinterest boards)</p>

<p>What were my accomplishments? (linkedin?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abbott Katz says “purchase receipts, which, unlike credit card entries, are time-stamped, sometimes to the second.”</li>
</ul>
