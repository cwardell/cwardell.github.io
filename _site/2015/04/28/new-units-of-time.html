				<p>My commute is one New Yorker article long.</p>

<p>My escalator ride is two emails long.</p>

<p>I can read 23 tweets in the line at the supermarket.</p>

<p>What new units of time have you discovered recently?</p>

<p>(This was originally sent to people who get my newsletter, which is sent sporadically and is very, very short. <a href="http://www.tinyletter.com/melodykramer">Want to subscribe?</a>)</p>

<p>Something interesting: many people think in terms of podcasts as a unit of time. (How could we surface audio by length of time?)</p>

<p><strong>More Units of Time</strong></p>

<p>From <strong>Michael</strong>: “Laundry (putting in washer and later folding) takes me one episode of Congressional Dish (less than an hour, not counting pledge drives)!”</p>

<p>From <strong>Aofunne</strong>: “My walk to work is 4 songs long. My download of Game of thrones is one Silicon Valley episode long.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Matthew</strong>: “Doing the dishes takes one “This American Life” act.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Rhonda</strong>: “I can listen to almost 2 songs while “running” half a mile on the elliptical at the gym. I tell myself, just one more song and you’re done! It helps ease the torture.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Donna</strong>: “A friend of mine’s parents used to measure things in terms of “Fraggle Rocks” (25 minutes).  “You need to work on your book report for 2 more Fraggle Rocks before you can play those video games”.”</p>

<p>From <strong>TJ</strong>: “A busy work day is half a podcast.  A regular workday is 2.  A day exploring the Smithsonian is 4 or 5.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Amy</strong>: “My commute to/from work is one podcast plus time to digest it.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Benjamin</strong>: “My commute to work is about two and a half Game of Thrones chapters long. Or one Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me. Or nearly two Reply All episodes. What I’m saying is my commute is looooong.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Freek</strong>: “my bike ride from my home in rotterdam to the train station is exactly one edm song long.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Ian</strong>: “The time it takes to unload the dishwasher is almost exactly the length of one NPR Morning Edition News Bulletin. I use the NPR One iOS app to play it on demand.”
r
From <strong>Alex</strong>: “My Saturday morning runs are three Fresh Air podcasts at 1.5 speed.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Angela</strong>: “I always tell people my house is a three-song walk away from Lake Michigan. (Unless one song is Jungleland. Then it would be two songs.)”</p>

<p>From <strong>Sebastian</strong>: “My commute to my job is exactly a chapter of Radio Ambulante´s podcast. It´s like it has been made for montevidean drivers who drive from my neighbourhood to the job.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Ruthann</strong>: “I still remember a roommate in the 1970s who measured distance in terms of units of beer.
“That sales call is a six-pack away.”</p>

<p>From anonymous: “my commute is one “agonizing inner debate about whether i’m taking the job offer i got”</p>

<p>From <strong>Benjamin</strong>: “My daily walk to Starbucks is almost exactly one play of Taylor Swift’s “Hey Stephen.””</p>

<p>From <strong>Kate</strong>: “I used to think of the plane ride from Mke To Bos or Dca as one Nora Roberts. ;-)”</p>

<p>From <strong>Gavin</strong>: “I can do one French lesson on the free app DuoLingo in the time it takes to walk from the parking garage to the office door.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Erie</strong>: “The metro ride home from the airport is one good cry (and evidence of the cry disappearing) long”</p>

<p>From <strong>Cait</strong>: “Approximately three songs to each mile of my run. And the opposite, I don’t take metro often but when I do, I let my brain be “bored” instead of plugged in to my phone. It’s now a contest of how many stops I can go without looking at my phone.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Angie</strong>: “…my previous commute was about two rows of a knitting project. Now I walk, so instead I play frogger on the parkway (even if I have the right of way!).”</p>

<p>From <strong>Gabe</strong>: “I’ve always used music as a unit of time. When I started to go running, I would run for the length of one full album (~45 minutes, give or take), which would both help me pace myself and be able to give an album a deep listen.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Josh</strong>: “My dog walk around the block is one short podcast long. Sometimes I walk around twice and listen to a longer podcast.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Topher</strong>: “A motorcycle ride home empties 10 hours of work problems from my mind.”</p>

<p>From <strong>ML</strong>: “My bus trip to NYC was four Serial podcasts.”</p>

<p>From anonymous: “The talk show I work for is approximately three email newsletters long.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Ben</strong>: “My walk to the post office to pick up mail lasts about as long as a good phone conversation with my grandparents. It’s a nice length of time.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Bill</strong>: “I can get through at least two chapters of a Young Adult novel during a Red Line commute to work.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Benji</strong>: “I measure my life with podcasts. It takes one usual episode of The Finish Line podcast from WBUR to make &amp; drink my morning coffee.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Elise</strong>: “When my brother was young we used to measure car rides in terms of SpongeBob episodes.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Joy</strong>: “My husband watches one episode of Breaking Bad per treadmill run.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Brandi</strong>: “My mom watches five videos via Facebook per cup of coffee. Videos = mix of hard news + dogs dressed as Elvis.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Sara</strong>: “My cross-country drive was 4 audiobooks, 1 full go-around w/ Serial &amp; Taylor Swift’s 1989 approx. 19.89 times.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Renee</strong>: “my commute to and from school is about 3 data science podcast episodes”</p>

<p>From <strong>Eric</strong>: “Weird to only now realize via @mkramer’s tiny letter that I internalize all commuting times in units of podcasts.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Annie</strong>: “Yoga session in time takes load of bath towels to dry in LG dryer.”</p>

<p>From <strong>Samantha</strong>: “if the weather is good, I can read on my walk to work. I live about 5 to 10 pages from work.”</p>
