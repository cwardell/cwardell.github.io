   Meet <a href="http://www.tanjaalexiahollander.com/">Tanja</a>. She&#8217;s a photographer who says &#8220;Seeing and sharing the world is my love.&#8221; She also makes videos and tells stories, and has been traveling around the country <a href="http://www.facebookportraitproject.com/">to take formal portraits</a> of every single one of her Facebook friends. &#8220;A friend called me a relationship hacker,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I like that a lot.&#8221;

  Tanja lives in Auburn, Maine. You should <a href="https://twitter.com/tanjahollander">follow her on Twitter</a>. Here&#8217;s how she gets her news. (If you’d like to read the others in the series, <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">please click here</a>. If you want to take part, just let me know.)
</div>

<p><strong>1. How do you get your news?</strong></p>

<p>It depends on what kind of news it is — almost all of it is online. My general everyday news, comes from links on Facebook or Twitter. And <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> (on the radio) at the end of the day. For breaking news, its 100% Twitter – I have lists of journalists by topic that I follow as my go to sources. I find stories on twitter usually come out 2-3 days before they do on FB or anywhere else. Then I usually keep up with <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/">Al Jazeera America</a> and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/">BBC</a>. For local news, its <a href="http://www.mpbn.net/">MPBN</a> (radio) and <a href="http://bangordailynews.com/">Bangor Daily News</a> online. Regional news, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/">Boston Globe</a> online. Art news, <a href="http://www.artnet.com/">artnet.com</a>; for tech it’s usually twitter. Oh and I’m enjoying <a href="http://instagram.com/nowthisnews">@nowthisnews</a> on Instagram. [I read / skim the paper when I’m at my parents house.]</p>

<p><strong>Ed note: She later sent this update:</strong></p>

<p>As I’m sitting here listening to Marketplace, I realize I try and listen to them everyday.   I guess I don’t think of them as “news” but I suppose it is?  And I also I really like the idea of <a href="http://www.beaconreader.com/" target="_blank">Beacon</a> and have enjoyed working with Dan Fletcher quite a bit over there.   But I don’t think of them as news either, more investigative journalism.  Is there a difference, do you think?  In my mind, news is current events.  But I suppose you could argue something like climate change is a current event.   Interesting to think about.</p>

<p><strong>2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.</strong></p>

<p>Totally drawing a blank here. Doesn’t sitting quietly staring at this question for 5 minutes count as a poem? gif’s make me bonkers (probably why I avoid Tumblr)</p>

<p><strong>3. How do you take your coffee?</strong></p>

<p>Just cream. As my friend Joe says, “The color of cardboard”</p>

<p><strong>4. Who’s doing it right in news?</strong></p>

<p>I’m not sure I could name an organization that is doing it right. But, I think there are a groups of journalists that are (both photojournalists and writers). For instance during Ferguson, I was following <a href="https://twitter.com/mattdpearce">Matt Pearce</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/wesleylowery">Wesley Lowery</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bmoreconetta">Christine Conetta</a>. They seemed to be working as a team even though they were covering for rivaling news outlets. They also were retweeting local news agencies and activists, which I thought showed respect for the community.</p>

<p><strong>5. What’s the first news event that you remember?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>‘s death. I remember the principal coming over the loud speaker (8th grade?) announcing a moment of silence. My recollection was she was about to be the first child astronaut and died on her way to being on a space shuttle. I was in public school in St. Louis at the time, but now I live in Maine where she was from. I just googled it to make sure I got her name right. According to Wikipedia (!), the plane she was in crashed in the little town I now live in. What a strange thing to discover. And also she was not on her way to becoming an astronaut. But she was still pretty awesome. <strong>(Ed note: I had never heard of this. Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Wikipedia entry</a>. It’s fascinating.)</strong></p>

<p><strong>6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?</strong></p>

<p>I had an acupuncture appointment that cured my photoshop hand / carpal tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?</strong></p>

<p>REPORTERS/PRODUCERS WHO DON’T FACT CHECK BEFORE THEY PUBLISH.</p>

<p><strong>8. What’s the best podcast or audio to listen to while doing chores?</strong></p>

<p>I’ve never been able to figure out a good system for podcasts so I don’t listen to them. I generally listen to music (NOLA brass bands are my go to) when I’m doing chores, except Sunday nights. Then I listen to <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/">TAL</a> and <a href="http://themoth.org/">the Moth</a> while I’m cooking for the week.</p>

<p><strong>9. How do you get your news when you travel around the world?</strong></p>

<p>I’m terrible at keeping up on the news when I’m traveling, but if I do, it’s the same as when I’m at home: the internet. However, when I’m road tripping in the States, I love finding local NPR stations!</p>
