				<p class="message">I am a Peabody-award winning digital strategist and evangelist with more than a decade of experience developing tools and strategies that help civic and public organizations build communities and engage with external and internal audiences in meaningful and effective ways. I am a broad and strategic thinker with a strong track record as an excellent writer and communicator who can manage teams while juggling a variety of key initiatives that support and communicate an organization’s mission and values. I love creating processes and tools that make workplaces more agile, creative, and enjoyable. <i>Public</i> is key to me: I deeply believe in the importance of strong and sustainable public institutions, and in the value of engaging people in improving and investing in these institutions. </p>
