				<p>Meet <a href="http://kyleesportfolio.com/blog/">Kylee Wall</a>. She’s a full-time <a href="http://kyleesportfolio.com/">film and TV editor</a> and a part-time portrait photographer. She has a cat named Pixel and loves to travel. “My favorite trip so far was LA (for an American Cinema Editors event), followed closely by being stranded in New York during a blizzard (for an American Film Institute directing workshop for women),” she says. “I’m a huge advocate for services like Airbnb and RelayRides, for feminism and equality, and for more television shows like X-Files and Twin Peaks.”</p>

<p>Kylee, who tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/kyl33t">@kyl33t</a>, was kind enough to answer some questions about how she gets her news. If you’d like to read the others in the series, <a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/category/how-do-you-get-the-news/">please click here</a>, and if you want to take part, just let me know.</p>

<p><strong>1. How do you get your news?</strong></p>

<p>Primarily through social media, which is something I realized would be a regular thing in 2009 when I found out about and followed the Ft. Collins <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113856719">balloon boy hoax</a> entirely <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=balloon%20boy%20since%3A2009-10-19%20until%3A2009-10-23&amp;src=typd">through Twitter</a>. Breaking news hits my Twitter feed the fastest, but Tumblr has also become a good discovery tool for “smaller” stories. Besides that, NPR radio (mostly <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/morning-edition/">Morning Edition</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/">All Things Considered</a>) and Al Jazeera’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera">posts on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>A few months ago I decided to add <a href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a> push notifications to my phone to see if there was news I was missing. The result of that experiment is a whole lot more noise with little gain, with regular updates on the stock market and sporting events or celebrity gossip — my own feeds are much more tailored to things I care about.</p>

<p><strong>2. Please send me a gif or video or poem that captures your attention span.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_m49o3t7KDz1rnbsolo1_500.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-385" src="http://www.melodyjk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/tumblr_m49o3t7KDz1rnbsolo1_500.gif" alt="x-files" width="500" height="335" /></a></p>

<p><strong>3. How do you take your coffee?</strong></p>

<p>Black. Matches my attire.</p>

<p><strong>4. Who’s doing it right in news?</strong></p>

<p>Comedians. <a href="http://thecolbertreport.cc.com/">Colbert</a>, <a href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/">Stewart</a> and <a href="http://www.iamjohnoliver.com/">Oliver</a>. They put together graceful, insightful commentary pieces that are well-researched and often self-deprecating, and I feel like I learn deeper facts about an issue through ten minutes with them than ten minutes of talking heads on CNN.</p>

<p><strong>5. What’s the first news event that you remember?</strong></p>

<p>The OJ Simpson verdict. This is also the first news event I remember discussing. I was in third grade and we had heated debates on the school bus. (First television event discussion was also on the bus: the reveal of the white Power Ranger.)</p>

<p><strong>6. What was the best thing that happened to you this week?</strong></p>

<p>I learned that my gender equality activism within the industry I work in is being given a major conference platform in the coming months, which is pretty awesome.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Where do you live? Region is fine. City is better, but optional.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m currently in Atlanta. I was born and raised in central Indiana.</p>

<p><strong>7. What do you absolutely hate about the news?</strong></p>

<p>The 24 hour cable news cycle. When a major event happens, I used to go to CNN for fast and curated updates about what’s happening. But every time I do that, I’m saturated with speculation, repetitious segments, or irresponsible reporting. Then I have to withdraw from current events for a period of time because I can’t take it anymore. There has to be a better way than making a horrifying incident into a sporting event.</p>

<p><strong>11. What’s the best podcast to listen to while doing chores?</strong></p>

<p>I don’t listen to podcasts while I do chores because I tend to stop when something is really blowing my mind. I once fell off the treadmill at a gym while listening to the “<a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/211119-colors/">Colors</a>” episode of Radiolab. When I’m not a danger to myself, <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/">Radiolab</a> and <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> are two of my favorites.</p>

<p><strong>12. How do you get your news when you travel?</strong></p>

<p>The nice thing about social media is that it doesn’t care when you travel. It’s still entirely possible to keep up with everything just the same. I have my Twitter follows sorted into <a href="https://twitter.com/kyl33t/lists">lists</a> with people who have a higher concentration of good links or current events tweets on one of them, so I can quickly switch to a focused list when I’m looking to be more specific.</p>
