				<p class="message">I have more than a decade of experience working as a digital product manager, strategist, editor, writer, and producer in newsrooms and startups. I've led both teams and projects — and come armed with skills ranging from audience engagement to product development to business strategy. I have a strong track record of designing and then building user-centered products that help organizations reach new audiences, build communities, and engage users and I love creating processes and tools that make workplaces more agile, creative, and enjoyable.</p>
