I frequently work on side projects or short-term engagements within the public media, podcasting, and civic technology space. Things I do:

<br><br>

- develop or improve audience engagement or existing social media strategies <br>

- make content consistent, structured, and easier to understand. <br>

- analyze existing analytics data and make recommendations for site and/or content improvements <br>

- help organizations ideate and develop new ways to reach audiences <br>

- critique grant proposals and/or help assess grant proposals <br>

<br>

Previous clients include a variety of public media organizations, podcasts, authors, non-profits, and trade publications. I'm happy to put you in touch with previous clients, if you'd like. Some highlights: <br><br>

- I organized and then led a online campaign to raise over 30,000$ for the Matthew Shepard Foundation over the course of one week. <br>

- I helped Fresh Air with Terry Gross reimagine their archives as a vehicle to further audience participation. <br>

- I reworked the social media strategy for a New York Times bestselling author, resulting in substantially more press in the ensuing months. <br>

<br>

If this interests you, I'm happy to work up a proposal for how we can work together. 

<br>

A quick note: I routinely volunteer for organizations but am not taking on any additional pro bono clients right now. If you want me to critique a quick idea or pick my brain, I'm happy to answer your questions via Twitter. <br>
