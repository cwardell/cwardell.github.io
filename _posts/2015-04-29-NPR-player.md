I was really happy to see that NPR launched a [new audio player](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thisisnpr/2015/04/29/401552958/there-are-now-800-000-reasons-to-share-npr-audio-on-your-site) today. It's smart and it immediately makes the audio more sharable.

One question:

If a piece is published from an acquired show or station, will the data collected from the player be shared? 

If not, this puts NPR at an advantage: they will know how many people have listened to a piece from a station, how the piece was shared, and eventually, I imagine, other bits of data like how long people listened and what topics resonate the most with people. 

This data is important for acquired shows and stations as they think about resources and staffing - and I hope the data is shared.
