I really dislike email subject headings. They tell me nothing. They're usually a bait and switch attempt to get me to open an email.

But here's one thing I did recently that made my email a bit more tolerable.

I color coded it.

At NPR, I said "If an email comes directly to me, make it blue. If I'm cc'ed, make it yellow. If it cc's a listserv I'm on, make it red." And so on. That way, I could glance at the inbox and know how to prioritize. 

This is how you do this in [Mail](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH4867). And in [Outlook](https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Automatically-change-incoming-message-colors-and-fonts-based-on-sender-subject-or-recipients-4efbf993-fb00-4f2c-9a3f-78e64e4455ec?CorrelationId=792c5de4-8bd9-45a6-abfa-d21d58794725&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US). And in [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/80637?hl=en). 

Have a good one, friends.
