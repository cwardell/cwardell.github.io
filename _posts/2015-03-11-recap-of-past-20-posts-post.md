Hello.


Many people wrote with great suggestions for new ways to categorize a random NPR story. I rounded [up all of the additional suggestions and added them to this post](http://melodykramer.github.io/2015/03/09/how-many-ways-could-we-categorize-this-piece/), with credit. There are lots of new suggestions! (Thank you!)


I also thought I would include links to all of my previous newsletters, in case you're new. (There are 20.) If you like this kind of stuff, please pass along the newsletter to others, particularly if you think they might like it. I love this stuff, as you can probably tell. If you tweet about it, use this link: [www.tinyletter.com/melodykramer](http://www.tinyletter.com/melodykramer) â€” Thank you.

PS: [This wasn't a newsletter](http://melodykramer.tumblr.com/post/46443618736/forward-thinking) but it still remains one of my favorite pieces of writing. And [this is a piece](http://www.poynter.org/news/media-innovation/324863/how-did-kpcc-get-voters-to-care-they-picked-one-and-made-him-care/) I wrote this week on the most innovative approach to local election coverage I've ever seen.
