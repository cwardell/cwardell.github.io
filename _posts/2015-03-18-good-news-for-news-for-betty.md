**News for Betty** :  
  
  
Last month I&nbsp;[wrote](http://melodykramer.github.io/how-betty-who-is-89-gets-her-news/)&nbsp;about my 89-year-old neighbor Betty and her difficulty accessing news websites. The story was picked up by a website called Hacker News, which covers startup and tech news, and sparked a&nbsp; [very interesting conversation](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9185356)&nbsp;about designing accessible websites for senior citizens.&nbsp;  
  
  
One of the people who read the piece was a guy named&nbsp;[Daniel](https://github.com/tagawa)&nbsp;who lives in Japan. He&nbsp;thought about what an accessible website would look like,&nbsp;registered the domain name newsforbetty.com, AND THEN CREATED&nbsp;[THE WEBSITE FOR BETTY!&nbsp;](http://www.newsforbetty.com/)&nbsp;It's open source, so you&nbsp; [can fork it and improve the experience for Betty](https://github.com/tagawa/newsforbetty). HOW AWESOME IS THAT?  
  
  
Last night, I went over to Betty's, and told her about all of this. First she said, "Does that mean I went viral?" Then&nbsp;[we went to the site](https://instagram.com/p/0WGD61gbQo/?taken-by=melodykramer)&nbsp;together. She loved it! She found it intuitive! She knew exactly what to do, without asking me â€” and she couldn't get lost on a homepage. Click a story, read a story, go back, do it again. That's it! It's now a bookmark on her iPad screen. Thank you so much Daniel!&nbsp;
