Yesterday A and I went to the DC Courthouse to get our marriage license because we're getting married in July. 
The process took an hour and involved a lot of waiting. 

While we were waiting, I did some thinking.

Getting married is probably one of the happiest reasons to enter a courthouse. (The others, I think, are adoption and citizenship.) 

In the waiting area, what if the city of DC provided:

1. voter registration forms

2. information about tax benefits for first-time homebuyers

3. reminders to check your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors

4. information about other city services

5. the ability to user-test new city websites (related: [better jury duty ideas](http://melodykramer.github.io/2015/03/22/good-ideas-for-jury-duty/).)

6. information about obtaining a library card and services the library offers people

The city has SUCH A GREAT OPPORTUNITY to connect with people who are visiting the courthouse a) by choice and b) for a really happy reason! It's a time when other information can also be disseminated.

What would you design for a marriage license waiting area?
